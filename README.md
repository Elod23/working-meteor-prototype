# working-meteor-prototype

Technology Stack:
  BACKEND: CURRENT STATE- Spring Boot 2.2.0.M2 : Spring Web, Spring Security, Data-Jpa, Logging, HATEOAS, MS SQL 2014, Log4j2
  FRONT-END : React, JSP, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 , maybe some Angular 2 usage.

Meteor S.R.L. ecommerce store prototye is currently under construction.

The project serves as the focal point of my Barchelor's thesis, being the subject of the research I am making:
  -Would like to outline the learning curve that a Junir Java Developer experiences during his first constribution to Spring Boot.
  -Measuring the demand of a local small business' owner over the development course of the project and comparing it to the larning curve I made,
  which will hopefully result into some solid statements that can be made about the local small business owners and also about your programmers using Spring Boot.
  
The application itself is an ecommerce store used in construction retail, aiming to motivate people not so experienced with computer usage to make orders online.
I will try to make the Front-End as simple and easily usable as it can be while the Backend as robust as the Spring framework itself.

2019.04.29> The project is changing from an ecommerce store to a presentation of the firm with all of their products by the decision of the owner. Today's discussion ended up with positive feedback and the collaboration is gaining strength. Now it is time to show how can I adapt to the new situation.



Anyone open to contribute with some ideas about know-how and personal ideas is asked to contanct me via email or facebook.
